Author: Rambod Azimi

This Python script gets the IP address of the printer with username and password

Then, it do the authorization process and goes to the following menus:

Print Server Settings --> Print Server --> Web Admin

Finally, it displays the content of that page (Admin name, password, http port, ...)


To run the program on your computer:

1) Make sure you have already installed python on your computer

2) Go to the code and change the IP address to your desired one (the default ip address http://192.168.1.93)

3) change the username and/or password as you wish (the default username is admin and the default password is 1234)

4) run the program using either VS Code or directly from the command line (/b python3 script.py or python script.py)

5) Enjoy!
